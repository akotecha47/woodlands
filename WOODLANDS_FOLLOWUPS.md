## FROM AUDIT #2 (2026-07-26) — DEFERRED

- **WOODLANDS_FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md route/role table is stale.** Lists seven roles that don't exist. Refresh at Sprint E fit-and-finish. Source: rename commit, 26 July.

## FROM SPRINTS

### Sprint A — Task 1 (migration `021_sprint_a_policies.sql`, 2026-07-26)

- **fm_market_days is not a table in the live DB.** MarketDayTab.jsx reads and writes it. Farmers Market monthly notes are broken in production. Escalated from "ghost table" to "live production bug." Must be CREATE'd (with RLS + policies + grants) in Sprint D — not just its policies added.

- **`fm_market_days` does not exist in the live database.** Confirmed absent from `pg_class` across all relkinds — it is not a table, view, or matview. `MarketDayTab.jsx:44` reads it and `:199`/`:205` write it, so the Farmers Market "market day notes" surface fails in production today. This is worse than the "ghost table" classification in AUDIT_2 §2.6, which assumed all four existed and were merely unmigrated. **Sprint D** — needs `CREATE TABLE` + RLS + policies, not just a back-filled migration.

- **The other three AUDIT_2 "ghost" tables do exist** — `event_checklists`, `shift_settings`, `tables` — with RLS enabled. Their `CREATE TABLE` statements are still absent from every migration. **Sprint D.**

- **`authenticated` held no usable grants on `event_checklists`, `shift_settings`, `tables`** — only `REFERENCES`/`TRIGGER`/`TRUNCATE`, so their pre-existing SELECT policies were unreachable. Granted in `021`. Worth checking the remaining tables for the same gap at Sprint D.

- **Duplicate `service_role` policies.** Six tables now carry two functionally identical `service_role … FOR ALL … USING(true)` policies: the pre-existing legacy-named `"service role full access {t}"` and the canonical `"service_role_all_{t}"` added by `021`. Sprint A was additive-only so the legacy ones were not dropped. **Sprint D** — collapse to one name per table. No security effect; both are permissive.

- **Remote migration history is missing versions 008–020.** `supabase migration list --linked` records only 001–007 as applied, though 008–020 demonstrably ran. `supabase db push` is therefore *unsafe* — it would replay `016_staff_restructure.sql` and duplicate all 62 real staff rows, re-run `018`'s DROP TABLE, and re-create `requisitions`. `021` was applied via the Management API query endpoint instead, and is not recorded in history either (it is written idempotently, so a future replay is harmless). **Sprint D** — `supabase migration repair --status applied` for 008–021 before `db push` is used again.

- **`021` is not itself in the migration history table.** See above. Idempotent by construction (`DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before every `CREATE POLICY`).

### Sprint A — Task 2 (`create-user` Edge Function, 2026-07-26)

- **CORS is now pinned to `https://woodlands-beta.vercel.app` only.** Calling the deployed function from a local dev server (`http://localhost:5173`) will be blocked by the browser. Intentional per the sprint brief. If local admin testing is needed, either run the function locally with `supabase functions serve` or add the dev origin to an explicit allowlist. **Sprint E.**

- **`ALLOWED_ROLES` in the Edge Function duplicates `src/lib/roles.js`.** Deno cannot import the browser module, so the four roles are listed in two places and kept in sync by hand. Adding a fifth role means editing both. **Sprint E** — consider a shared JSON constant.

### Sprint B — Task 2 (`public-checkin` Edge Function, 2026-07-26)

- **`/checkin` still has no rate limit and holder UUIDs remain guessable-by-possession.** The Edge Function stopped the PII exposure (four columns returned, no listing, no search, inactive indistinguishable from missing), but prior-audit finding 2.3 is only *reduced*, not closed. Anyone holding a valid holder UUID — a photographed QR code, a shared link — can still check that holder in or out. Proper fix is a signed, expiring token in the QR rather than a raw UUID. **Sprint E.**

- **`public-checkin` is deployed with `--no-verify-jwt`.** Required — it is a public route with no caller to verify. Redeploying it without that flag will silently break every QR code. Not expressible in source: there is still no `supabase/config.toml`.

- **Market-day maths is now duplicated.** `getMarketDayForMonth` exists in `src/components/farmers-market/FarmersMarketUI.jsx` and is re-implemented in `supabase/functions/public-checkin/index.ts` (Deno cannot import the browser module). The Deno copy computes in Africa/Blantyre (UTC+2) rather than the host's UTC, to preserve the browser's previous local-time behaviour. If the market-day rule changes, both must change. **Sprint E.**

- **`check_in` / `check_out` write paths are not verified end-to-end.** Only `lookup` was probed live; exercising the writes would have fabricated a visit row for a real stall holder. Needs a browser smoke test.

### Sprint B — Task 3 (anon-client migration, 2026-07-26)

- **`attendance_records` still carries an `ALL`/`authenticated` blanket policy.** `USING (true) WITH CHECK (true)`, alongside its scoped INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE policies. This is the same shape as the stale `staff` policy dropped in Sprint A, on a table holding real staff attendance — any authenticated user of any role can rewrite any attendance row. It was out of scope for both Sprint A (which named only `staff`) and Sprint B. **Sprint C or D — should be dropped and replaced with scoped policies.**

- **Key rotation must update the Edge Function secret in the same window.** Both `create-user` and `public-checkin` read `Deno.env.get('SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')`, a manually-set project secret. Rotating the service_role key in the Supabase dashboard does *not* update it. If it is not updated, user creation AND all public QR check-in break simultaneously. See `src/lib/standards.md` §4.

- **`store_supervisor` gates left in place.** `LogDeliveryTab.jsx:7` and `TransfersTab.jsx:7` still list a role that cannot exist, and `InventoryUI.jsx:82` filters on it. Migration 022 deliberately did not grant it anything. Those two tabs remain `AccessDenied` to everyone except owner/manager. **Sprint E.**

- **Inventory module had no runtime exercise.** All seven files were migrated to the anon client, but the module is unreachable (`ROUTE_ACCESS` keys `/inventory`, route is `/`). Its policies and grants are therefore untested against a real session. First real test will be after the Sprint E route fix.

### Sprint B — Task 4 smoke test (2026-07-26)

- **Event Add Payment broken since 28 May 2026.** `event_payments.received_by` FKs to `auth.users(id)` but the dropdown at EventPaymentsSection.jsx:207 populates from the `staff` table. Any staff.id inserted fails the FK. Also inconsistent within the same table: `recorded_by` correctly FKs to `user_profiles`.

  **Fix confirmed by Aman — Sprint C task, not an open choice:**
  - Populate the Received By dropdown from **`user_profiles`**, not `staff`. The read path at `:162` already resolves `received_by` through `userMap` (built from `user_profiles` at `:30`), and `user_profiles.id` satisfies the `auth.users(id)` FK by construction.
  - **No migration.** The FK stays pointed at `auth.users`.
  - Scope is `EventPaymentsSection.jsx` only: dropdown source plus label rendering. Concretely — drop the `fetchAllActiveStaff()` call at `:31` and the `staff` state at `:10`, render the dropdown at `:207` from the existing `user_profiles` data instead, and update the `:206` placeholder ("Select staff member…") since the list is now system users rather than the roster.
  - Consequence to note: payments can then only be attributed to one of the four login users, not to any of the 62 roster staff. That is the intended semantics — `received_by` has always been an `auth.users` reference.

  *Diagnosis notes:* not a Sprint B regression. `git blame` puts the dropdown source (`:207`), the `fetchAllActiveStaff()` call (`:31`) and the import (`:5`) at commits `e638646` and `e63c7fb`, both 2026-05-28. Sprint B's only change to this file was the `supabaseAdmin` → `supabase` identifier rename. The FK was always enforced — the service-role key bypasses RLS, never constraints — so this path has never worked for any role since it was built. First exercised during the Sprint B smoke test.

### Sprint B — Task 5 (key rotation, 2026-07-26)

- **~~`auth.admin.createUser` unverified against the rotated secret~~ — CLOSED 26 July 2026.** Verified during the Sprint B smoke test: Aman created a burner user through Admin → Add User successfully, then removed it via the Supabase dashboard. **`sb_secret_*` keys do perform `auth.admin.createUser`.** `public-checkin` had already proved the secret valid for service-role PostgREST reads, so both Edge Function paths are now confirmed working against the new key pair. (The dashboard deletion is the separate delete-user gap logged below.)

- **~~`src/lib/standards.md` §4 may be stale~~ — CORRECTED 26 July 2026.** §4 previously mandated storing "the JWT value" in `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, which the key-system migration made wrong. Now records that `sb_secret_*` is the correct format and works for `auth.admin`. The underlying rule is unchanged and still load-bearing: use the *manually set* `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, not the runtime's auto-injected `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

- **No fresh manual backup was taken before Sprint B.** Confirmed by Aman as a deliberate call (backups live on Supabase, not locally). The restore point going into this sprint was the automatic backup of 26 July 02:30:54 UTC, which predates migrations 021 and 022. Both are idempotent and in git, so they are replayable, but any data written after that timestamp is not covered. **Take a manual snapshot before Sprint C**, which touches money and quantity logic.

- **No delete-user path in Admin.** Sprint B added authenticated create-user; deactivate hides the user but doesn't remove the auth.users or user_profiles rows. Aman had to delete manually via Supabase dashboard during Sprint B smoke test. Deactivate is likely the correct operational default (preserves FK integrity across recorded_by, created_by, etc.), but a genuine delete-user Edge Function + Admin button is a Sprint E fit-and-finish item if wanted. Decision: keep deactivate as default, add hard-delete option at Sprint E.

## FROM SPRINT C

### Sprint C — Task 1 (Add Payment FK fix, 2026-07-26)

- **`event_payments.recorded_by` is never populated.** The column exists and FKs to `user_profiles(id)`, but `handleAddPayment` in `EventPaymentsSection.jsx` does not set it — no payment in the system records who entered it, only who received it (`received_by`). `const { session } = useAuth()` sits unused at `:8`, which suggests `recorded_by: session.user.id` was intended and dropped. Pre-existing since the module was built; confirmed against `git show HEAD` before the Task 1 change. Not fixed in Task 1 (out of its stated scope), and AUDIT_2 did not flag it. **Sprint E** — one-line fix, but it changes insert behaviour on a money table so it wants its own verification. Same question applies to other `recorded_by`/`created_by` columns across the schema.

### Sprint C — Task 2 (amount CHECK constraints, 2026-07-26)

- **`event_bill_items.amount > 0` forbids a zero-value line.** Verified by probe: an `amount = 0` bill item is now rejected. That means a genuinely complimentary or comped item cannot be recorded at zero — it would have to be omitted or priced. No such row exists today (7 bill items, all positive), and `> 0` was the specified constraint. If comped lines turn out to be wanted operationally, relax to `>= 0` in a **new migration** rather than dropping the constraint. Worth asking Dhiren at handover. **Sprint E / handover question.**

- **Refunds confirmed to be stored positive.** `event_payments` records refunds as `payment_type = 'refund'` with a positive `amount`, subtracted in the UI (`EventPaymentsSection.jsx:46-48`, rendered parenthesised at `:156-159`). So `amount > 0` does not block refunds. Noted because a future session might reasonably assume refunds are negative and try to relax the constraint.

### Sprint C — Task 3 (stock clamp + returned_qty, 2026-07-26)

- **4 legacy allocations carry an unknowable deduction amount.** `event_stock_allocations` holds 6 rows: 4 `deducted` (16 units) and 2 `pending` (42 units). The 4 deducted rows were deducted before Sprint C, when the clamp could silently remove less than `allocated_qty`. Nothing recorded the real figure and event stock deduction writes no `stock_movements` row, so it cannot be reconstructed. They were **deliberately not backfilled** — setting `deducted_qty = allocated_qty` would assert the clamp never fired, which is unverifiable. They read as `coalesce(deducted_qty, allocated_qty)`, i.e. exactly today's behaviour. If any of those 4 events is later cancelled or cleared, the return could still over-credit stock by the historical shortfall. **Sprint D** — either reconcile against a physical stock count or accept and close.

- **`AdjustmentsTab` is a fourth site that writes stock, not covered by Task 4's three.** `AdjustmentsTab.jsx:42-55` inserts a `stock_movements` row and *then* upserts `current_stock`. It sets an absolute quantity (a stock take) rather than applying a delta, so it has no clamp bug — but if the upsert fails, e.g. on the `quantity >= 0` CHECK, the movement row is already committed, leaving a ledger entry with no corresponding stock change. `apply_stock_delta` does not fit it directly because the operation is a set, not a delta. **Raised with Aman before Task 4** per the sprint's scope-surprise stopping rule.

## FROM SPRINT C SMOKE TEST

*Found by Aman during the Sprint C browser verification, 26 July 2026. For Sprint D/E — which run tonight, not "later".*

- **Kitchen manager sees Farmers Market cards on Dashboard** (should be Dashboard-only per the role table). Fix in Sprint E.
- **"Needs Attention" cards on Dashboard link to `/login`** — likely the `/inventory` redirect. Fix with the `/inventory` route fix in Sprint E.
- **Top-right notification bell + search bar non-functional** — wire up or remove before demo. Sprint E.
- **Owner has no visible stock page** — `/inventory` unreachable. Sprint E priority-one, this is what Dhiren will click first.
- **Completed events with outstanding balance are invisible** (event `ww`: 500k unpaid after completion). Ask Dhiren tomorrow whether this needs a card/filter. Sprint E if yes.

### Sprint B — carried from Task 2 setup

- **No `supabase/config.toml` in the repo.** The deployed `verify_jwt` setting is still not expressible in source. The function no longer depends on it (it verifies the caller itself), but the setting remains undocumented. **Sprint D.**
