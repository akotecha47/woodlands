## FROM SPRINTS

### Sprint A — Task 1 (migration `021_sprint_a_policies.sql`, 2026-07-26)

- **`fm_market_days` does not exist in the live database.** Confirmed absent from `pg_class` across all relkinds — it is not a table, view, or matview. `MarketDayTab.jsx:44` reads it and `:199`/`:205` write it, so the Farmers Market "market day notes" surface fails in production today. This is worse than the "ghost table" classification in AUDIT_2 §2.6, which assumed all four existed and were merely unmigrated. **Sprint D** — needs `CREATE TABLE` + RLS + policies, not just a back-filled migration.

- **The other three AUDIT_2 "ghost" tables do exist** — `event_checklists`, `shift_settings`, `tables` — with RLS enabled. Their `CREATE TABLE` statements are still absent from every migration. **Sprint D.**

- **`authenticated` held no usable grants on `event_checklists`, `shift_settings`, `tables`** — only `REFERENCES`/`TRIGGER`/`TRUNCATE`, so their pre-existing SELECT policies were unreachable. Granted in `021`. Worth checking the remaining tables for the same gap at Sprint D.

- **Duplicate `service_role` policies.** Six tables now carry two functionally identical `service_role … FOR ALL … USING(true)` policies: the pre-existing legacy-named `"service role full access {t}"` and the canonical `"service_role_all_{t}"` added by `021`. Sprint A was additive-only so the legacy ones were not dropped. **Sprint D** — collapse to one name per table. No security effect; both are permissive.

- **Remote migration history is missing versions 008–020.** `supabase migration list --linked` records only 001–007 as applied, though 008–020 demonstrably ran. `supabase db push` is therefore *unsafe* — it would replay `016_staff_restructure.sql` and duplicate all 62 real staff rows, re-run `018`'s DROP TABLE, and re-create `requisitions`. `021` was applied via the Management API query endpoint instead, and is not recorded in history either (it is written idempotently, so a future replay is harmless). **Sprint D** — `supabase migration repair --status applied` for 008–021 before `db push` is used again.

- **`021` is not itself in the migration history table.** See above. Idempotent by construction (`DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before every `CREATE POLICY`).
